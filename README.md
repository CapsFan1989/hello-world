Beginnner's guide to Git(Hub)

Hello everyone!

I am new to Git and GitHub. I am starting a position which will utilize Python, and likely Git and GitHub in a few weeks.
I look forward to attending the Unidata Python and AWIPS workshop from June 5-7, 2017.
The programming languages in which I have the most comfort and experience are IDL and Fortran.
